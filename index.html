   <h2>Neurolinguistics</h2>
   <p>The brain is the body part that is responsible for initiating speech acts and listening comprehension. Before studying linguistics, I didn’t think much about how the brain functions; maybe you haven’t either. Nonetheless, from the beginning of time, philosophers have tried to understand the way the brain works, how language works, and the relationship between the two. In the early days, language wasn’t associated with the brain. Fun fact: Example: Aristotle thought the brain was just a cold sponge whose purpose was to cool the blood.</p>

   <h2>What is the study of the relationship between the brain and language called?</h2>
   <p>Neuro-linguistics. The first thing to study is the brain itself. Examples: First are the neurons, which are the nerve cells in the brain. There are about 100 billion per person. Next is the cortex, which is the surface area, or gray matter. The importance of the cortex is that it is the decision making organ. It receives messages from the body, produces voluntary actions, and is where language knowledge is stored. Note: The motor cortex, a strip on the left side above the ear, is responsible for movement, and a small part of that controls the muscles of the jaw, tongue, and face, making that area important for speech. Additional examples: The sulci and the gyri are the folds, inward and outward respectively,
    in the cortex. Next are the two sides of the brain, called the hemispheres, which are connected by the corpus callosum. Note: Each side supervises the other side’s activities (the right brain controls a wave of the left hand, for example). This is called contralateral functioning. There is more information about the parts of the brain in the Supplemental Material section.

   <h2>What aspects of life other than language are associated with the two hemispheres of the brain?</h2>
   <p>First, on the right: music, humor, poetry, feelings, ability to match, facial recognition, spatial relationships, etc. And on the left: rhythm, time, ordering, math, analyzing, etc. Note: Some people are right-brain dominant, others are left, and a few are “ambidextrous.” Which are you?
      On which side of the brain does language fall? The left! Language was the first cognitive skill to be localized scientifically. Comment: In 1864, a French doctor, Paul Broca, explained that the front left side (just in front of the ear) of the brain must be responsible for language based on his study of people with left frontal lobe damage who had speech problems that didn’t show up for those with similar right hemisphere damage. Additional comment: This was determined via autopsies. In his journals, Broca noted the speech issues of his patients; then after death he examined their brains and found damage only on the left side.
    
      Today, MRIs and PET scans are used to see if a person has damage in Broca’s area. His area is said to be the language production center of the brain. Note: Left- handed people don’t seem to lateralize exclusively to the left side as right-handed people do; they have language centers on both sides, which isn’t better, just another curious phenomenon of brain development.
